# Glossary of Development Terms

##### 1. Spiral Lifecycle Model

The Spiral lifecycle model is an example of a risk-driven model. This means that the success of a project depends on how well risk analysis is carried our. Analysis is the process of estimating and monitoring the probability of completing tehnical challanges in your project and to account for other possible issues such as cost increases. In the spiral lifecycle model, the higher the risk is deemed to be. the more effort is places on completing that task.

###### How Risk Is Managed

Risks are events that could potentially prevent the development team from reaching its objective. There are alot of possible risks, from trivial to fatal. Trivial are risks that could cause delays to the project but not stop the completion of the project as a whole. Fatal risks are ones that could stop the enire project form being completed.

The first task for the development team is to all the possible risks and prioritize them according to importance and how much impact they could have on the project. By prioritizing, a team can focus on minizing the risks that would have the biggest impact on the success of the project.

The next step is for the team to come up with any potential solutions that can help to overcome or minimize the risks. The solutions can cause changes at the next steps as they may involve doing stages differently or some stages taking more time to complete. At the end of the risk management stage, a prototype is produced.

###### What Is It Best Used For?

The Spiral model is best used on very large projects with ever changing tasks and challenges that will require new versions of the project to be constantly rolled out. An example of this is the development of operating systems such as iOS, as new versions are required to be released and tested regularly.

##### 2. Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model is an example sequential software development process, where progress flows toward the conclusion. through the phases of a project (analysis, planning, design, development, testing). This involves fully documenting a project in advance, including the user interface, user stories, and all the featuresâ€™ variations and outcomes.

##### 3. Evolutionary Model

This model is the idea of developing an initial software idea from very broad specifications. Each version of you make will inherit the best features from earlier versions. Each version is changed based upon feedback from yourself or your team members to produce a system which meets the clients needs. At this point the system may be delivered. development and validation are done at the same time with feedback between each.

##### 4. Prototype Model

The idea of the Prototype model is that instead of defining the requirements before a design or coding can proceed, a disposable prototype is built to understand the requirements. This idea in this prototype are then developed further as requirements are understood and mapped out.

##### 5.  Feasibility Report

A feasibility report is a report that is made to determine how feasible a project is before the project begins. The different sections are designed to present the individual challanges in that section and talk about any potential solutions to these challenges. When potential solutions are presented, they are expanded upon in depth to explain exactly how this would solve the problem. Once a solution is agreed upon, it is sent to the project manager for authorization.

A Feasibility report will contain the following:

###### Proposed Project Description

This segment is for essentially describing the project that is being worked on and goes into detail about the time contraints and how much the project will cost, not only money but in terms of manpower too..

###### Market Analysis Section

This section looks at the market that the current project will be targeted at. Detailing the size of the market and its demographic  using availible data or by completing surveys. This is done to determine if a venture into this market will be profitable.

###### Technical Feasibility Section

Technical Feasibility covers the ability to complete the programming and other techinical challanges.

###### Financial Feasibility Section

The Financial Feasibility section talks about any costs that come with the project and if the venture is profitable, this can include costs of software, staff payments and bills.

##### 6. How Can Technical Solutions Be Compared

Technical solutions can be compared based on the following factors:  

Fitness: Does the technology address the problem at hand, or is it being used for an unintended purpose?

Maturity: It's risky to use version 1.0 of anything. Both hardware and software companies are frequently pressed to release products before they are ready.

Support: If something goes wrong, who/how many people can help solve the problem? While commercial (paid) support is appreciated, open-source products with large numbers of helpful users can be even more valuable.

Reliability/availability/scalability: Does the technology support the required usage volume? Does it offer fail-over mechanisms for high availability?

License and support costs: What are the one-time and annual costs of using a technology? While you might have a favorite piece of software, is there an adequate free or low-cost open-source alternative? Keep in mind that even open-source software can be expensive if the vendor restricts commercial use or has inconvenient licensing terms.

##### 7. The Importance of Team Dynamics

Team Dynamics referes to anything to do with the relationship between the members of a team and how it impacts the perfomace of the team. Dynamics can be affected by certain variables such as roles and responsabilities and all have an affect on productivity. For example, if a group of 4 friends were working together on a project, this past relationship could have a positive or a negative impact on how well the team works together. The friends past relationship could allow them to get to work more quickly, and understand eachother strengths and weaknesses straight away, allowing each member to work to their strengths and support eachother easily. On the other hand, the group could easily begin to argue, as they would likley spend their time outside of the work enviroment together too and person arguments could then affect the performance of memebers.
