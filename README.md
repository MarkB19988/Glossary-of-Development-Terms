##### 1. Spiral Lifecycle Model

The Spiral lifecycle model is an example of a risk-driven model. This means that the success of a project depends on how well risk analysis is carried our. Analysis is the process of estimating and monitoring the probability of completing tehnical challanges in your project and to account for other possible issues such as cost increases. In the spiral lifecycle model, the higher the risk is deemed to be. the more effort is places on completing that task.

##### 2.  Feasibility Report

A feasibility report is designed to present the individual challanges in a project and talk about any potential solutions to these challanges. When potential solutions are presented, they are expanded upon in depth to explain exactly how this would solve the problem. Once a solution is agreed upon, it is sent to the project manager for authorization.
