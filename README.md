# Glossary of Development Terms


##### 1. Spiral Lifecycle Model (Iterative)
The Spiral lifecycle model is an example of a risk-driven model. This means that the success of a project depends on how well risk analysis is carried our. Each risk is analysed and ordered based on how severe each risk is. This analysis involves estimating the probability of completing tehnical challanges in your project and accounting for other possible issues such as cost increases. In the spiral lifecycle model, the higher the risk is deemed to be. the more effort is placed on completing that task.

###### Advantages
- Flexible, allows for changes in the project during development
- Useful for larger projects

###### Disadvantages
- Can be costly to use
- Doesn't work well for small projects

###### How Risk Is Managed in the Spiral Lifecycle Model
The spiral lifecycle model is risk-driven and success of the project is heavily influenced by how well the risk analysis is carried out. Risks are evaluaed after every iteration of the project. Risk analysis after every iteration requires someone to have a specific skillset. There are alot of possible risks, from trivial to fatal. Trivial are risks that could cause delays to the project but not stop the completion of the project as a whole. Fatal risks are ones that could stop the enire project form being completed.

After every iteration, the team will come togther and check if all risks from the previous iteration have been dealt with. Once this is done, they will then analyse the new iteration and produce a new set of risks that are related to this iteration and start the process of dealing with and minimizing these new risks until the next iteration is released.


###### What Is It Best Used For?
The Spiral model is best used on very large projects with ever changing tasks and challenges that will require new versions of the project to be constantly rolled out. An example of this is the development of operating systems such as iOS, as new versions are required to be released and tested regularly.


##### 2. Waterfall Model (Sequentional)
The Waterfall Model is an example sequential software development process, where progress flows toward the end. The main phases that any software delopment task would go through are analysis, planning, design, development and testing. The waterfall model involves fully planning and documenting each of these stages in advance and sticking to this plan. In the waterfall model there is no room for change once the plan has been put in place, every stage in the waterfall model has a set time for completion and if this deadline is missed is can prove to be very difficult to go back.

###### Advantages
- Easy to see what needs to be done next
- Phases do not overlap

###### Disadvantages
- Dificult to go back and change things
- High amount of risk


##### 3. Evolutionary Model (Iterative)
This model is the idea of developing an initial software idea from very broad specifications. Each version of you make will inherit the best features from earlier versions. Each version is changed based upon feedback from yourself or your team members to produce a system which meets the clients needs. At this point the system may be delivered. development and validation are done at the same time with feedback between each.

###### Advantages
- Better risk analysis than sequential models
- Early prototypes allow for early client feedback

###### Disadvantages
- Not good for smaller projects
- Can create a higher workload than other models


##### 4. V-Model (Sequential)
 The V Model is a sequential model in which the steps flow downwards towards the goal. However, the steps are displyed upwards after the coding phase, to form a V shape. This V shape shows what relationship each step has between its associated testing phase. The biggest difference between the V model and the waterfall model is the implementation early test planning in the V model. At the end of the V model is the Verification and Validation phase that happens after all of the testing is completed, this phase is about testing the project as a whole and making sure that everything works together as intended.
 
###### Advantages
- Easy to understand and simple to use
- Easy management thanks to a review after each phase

###### Disadvantages
 - Not good for more complex projects where things might change
 - No prototypes are developed that can limit early client feedback
 
##### 5.  Feasibility Report
A feasibility report is a report that is made to determine how feasible a project is before the project begins. The different sections are designed to present the individual challanges in that section and talk about any potential solutions to these challenges. When potential solutions are presented, they are expanded upon in depth to explain exactly how this would solve the problem. Once a solution is agreed upon, it is sent to the project manager for authorization.

Requirement gathering is a key part of any feasibility report. It relates to finding out what you and your team will need in order to complete the project. This can include what software will be required, how many people will be required or any assets that will need to be purchased to name a few.

A Feasibility report will contain review and research on the following:

###### Proposed Project Description
This section is for describing the project that is being worked on and goes into detail about the time contraints and how much the project will cost, not only in terms of money but in terms of manpower too. This section can vary in size and detail depending on the type of project that is being worked on.


###### Market Analysis Section
This section looks at the market that the current project will be targeted at. Detailing the size of the market and its demographic  using availible data or by completing surveys. This is done to determine if a venture into this market will be profitable. The project usually needs to be deemed profitable in order to have any chance of being completed.


###### Technical Feasibility Section
Technical Feasibility covers the ability to complete the programming and other techinical challenges. These challenges are things that can get in the way and slow down development on the project. This section will talk about what these challenges are and if they are realistically able to be overcome.


###### Financial Feasibility Section
The Financial Feasibility section talks about any costs that come with the project and if the venture is profitable, this can include costs of software, staff payments and bills. This section can have close ties to the Market Analysis section but goes into more detail of exactly what money the project is expected to make.


##### 6. How Can Technical Solutions Be Compared
Technical solutions can be compared based on the following factors:  

Fitness: Does the software address and fix the given problem, or is it being used for an unintended and possibly malicious purpose?

Maturity: It's risky to use the first version of anything, including software. Both hardware and software development companies are frequently pressured to release products before they are ready. This can lead to issues with the product being found by users after release. 

Support: If the product goes wrong, who can help resolve the issue? While commercial support is appreciated, open-source products with large numbers of users can prove to be even more valuable in the area of problem solving.

License and support costs: What are both the one time and annual costs of using the technology? You may have a favorite piece of software to use for this task, however you have to ask 'is there an free or low-cost alternative?' However even open source software can be expensive if the vendor restricts commercial or business use or has bad licensing terms.

##### 7. The Importance of Team Dynamics

Team Dynamics referes to anything to do with the relationship between the members of a team and how it impacts the perfomace of the team. Dynamics can be affected by certain variables such as roles and responsabilities and all have an affect on productivity. For example, if a group of 4 friends were working together on a project, this past relationship could have a positive or a negative impact on how well the team works together. The friends past relationship could allow them to get to work more quickly, and understand eachother strengths and weaknesses straight away, allowing each member to work to their strengths and support eachother easily. On the other hand, the group could easily begin to argue, as they would likley spend their time outside of the work enviroment together too and person arguments could then affect the performance of memebers.
